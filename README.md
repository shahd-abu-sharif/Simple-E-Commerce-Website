# Simple E-Commerce Website


**Description**:

This is a simple front-end E-Commerce web app built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

It includes the following features:

* Displays a grid of 8 products with images, names, prices, and descriptions
* Each product has **“+” and “−” buttons** to select quantity
* A live cart preview shows the **total number of items** and **total price**
* A **search bar** allows filtering products by name or description

The structure:

* `index.html` handles the layout
* `styles.css` styles the product cards, layout, buttons, and cart display
* `script.js` manages product rendering, cart logic, search functionality, and quantity updates

This project demonstrates how to build an interactive product catalog with basic e-commerce logic, suitable for beginners learning front-end development.

You can expand it with:

* Add to cart functionality
* Checkout page
* Product categories
* Price filtering
* Backend integration for real products and orders
